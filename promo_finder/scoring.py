"""Heuristic judge: scores one candidate window against the brief's three tests.

    hook        something in the first 3 s makes a scrolling viewer stop
    cliffhanger it cuts at an unresolved moment
    standalone  it makes sense to someone who has never seen the show

plus ``tension`` (is it a confrontation that escalates?) and ``pace`` (no dead
air, sensible length). Weights sum to 100.

This is a *screening* judge: free, offline, deterministic and explainable. It
cannot understand a story - that is what the optional LLM judge is for. Every
sub-score is returned so a human can see *why* a window ranked where it did.
